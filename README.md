The first project for the course AST 381, Fall 2017 at UT Austin. The goal of 
the project is as follows: 

1. Make a function that takes the orbital elements and specified time of a 
pair of objects, such as a binary system or star and planet.
2. Predicts the relative astrometry as seen by Gaia.
3. Predicts the absolute astrometry of each object compared to the center-of-
mass (CoM).
4. Predicts the RV (radial-velocity) of each object compared to the CoM.
5. Predicts the directly imaged orbit.
6. Predict when transits happen.
